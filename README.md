# This app is developed from tutorial https://developers.sap.com/group.ios-sdk-setup.html
* I've used version 5.0 of the SDK for iOS released 3/7/20: https://blogs.sap.com/2020/03/06/cp-sdk-for-ios-5.0-released/
* The only real differences I noted on sight were 
    1) service destination was not visible in the SDK as in the screenshots and 
    2) view controllers for each collection appear to be in folders under com.sap.edm.sampleservice.v2. This may be a result of using the Mobile Services config on the cloud, though, rather than v5 of the iOS SDK.
